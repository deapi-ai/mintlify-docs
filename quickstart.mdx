### 3. Load Credits to Your Account

deAPI operates on a pay-as-you-go model.

| Account Type | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**    | \$5 welcome bonus, conservative rate limits for testing |
| **Premium**  | 300 RPM, unlimited daily requests across all endpoints  |

Your **\$5 bonus** is available immediately upon registration for testing with Basic rate limits.

To upgrade to **Premium** (300 RPM and unlimited daily requests), simply top up your account with any available amount (\$10, \$25, or \$50) via Stripe. Your remaining bonus balance carries over after upgrade.

To add funds, go to your [Dashboard → Billing](https://deapi.ai/billing) section.
