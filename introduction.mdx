## What is deAPI?

deAPI provides fast and affordable inference for open-source AI models — without infrastructure overhead.

Run image, video, audio, and text workloads through a single, consistent API.

deAPI handles GPU orchestration, execution, and scaling so you can focus on building applications, not managing infrastructure.

Under the hood, deAPI runs on a global, decentralized GPU network, allowing significantly lower inference costs compared to traditional cloud providers.

## What you can build

With deAPI, you can power a wide range of AI applications:

- **Image generation** — Create and edit images using modern diffusion models
- **Text-to-speech** — Generate natural-sounding speech for applications and products
- **Video AI** — Video generation, transcription, and analysis
- **Document & text processing** — OCR and text extraction from documents and images
- **Multimodal workflows** — Combine text, image, audio, and video in a single application

A full, up-to-date list of supported models is available here:
