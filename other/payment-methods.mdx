### Single payments (one-off top-ups)

On the **Balance** page you can make a one-off payment:

- Choose a top-up amount (e.g. **$1**, **$10**, **$25**, **$50**).
- Pay securely via **Stripe** (card and supported local methods).
- The selected amount is immediately converted into credits and added to your account balance.

Use this option if you prefer to control every top-up manually.

### Automatic payments (auto top-ups)

You can also enable **automatic top-ups** to keep your projects running without interruption:

- Pick a recurring top-up amount (e.g. **$10**, **$25**, **$50**).
- When your balance drops below **$2.00**, deAPI will automatically:
  - charge the selected amount via Stripe, and
  - add the corresponding credits to your account.
- You can turn automatic top-ups on or off at any time from the **Balance** page.

This is recommended for production workloads where you don't want jobs to fail due to insufficient credits.

### Other payment options & B2B billing

At the moment, **Stripe** is the primary payment provider for deAPI.

For **B2B customers**, payment terms and billing methods (e.g. custom invoices, larger commitments) are discussed individually.
If you are interested in a B2B agreement, please contact us at **support@deapi.ai**.
