#### 1. **How do I get access to the deAPI panel?**

Register or log in (also via Google OAuth) and after authentication you will automatically gain access to the Control Panel, where you can directly create an API key and get access the full capabilities of the platform.

---

#### 2. **How can I get my API key?**

Simply sign up or log in, then navigate to your Dashboard → Settings → API Keys and click "Create new secret key" to instantly generate your API key.

---

#### 3. **Do I need to fund my account before using the API?**

No. Upon first registration, you receive a **20 USD bonus** to get started. After you use this bonus, you can top up your balance directly from the dashboard via Stripe, using one-off payments or automatic top-ups.

---

#### 4. **How is authentication handled?**

Every API request requires an `Authorization` header with your personal token:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

---

#### 5. **How do I retrieve the results of my tasks?**

After submitting a task, you'll receive a `request_id`. Use this ID with the **Get Results** endpoint (`GET /api/v1/client/request-status/{request_id}`) to fetch your generated image, video, audio, or transcription.

---

#### 6. **Are there any rate limits?**

Yes. The default rate limit for all standard accounts is **300 jobs per minute** (applicable to all task types: video, audio, image). If you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Higher quotas may be provisioned based on platform utilization — contact support for High Volume Production requirements.

#### 7. **Can I choose between different AI models?**

Yes. Visit the **Model Selection** endpoint to browse available models, or check the **Models** page for a complete list. You can specify the desired model using the `model` parameter when making API requests.
