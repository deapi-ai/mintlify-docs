Text-to-Image generates images from text prompts. The endpoint returns a ready-to-use image URL and a task ID to track processing status. Ideal for apps needing automated image creation.

<Note>
**Prerequisite:** To ensure a successful request, you must first consult the [Model Selection](/api/utilities/model-selection) endpoint to identify a valid model `slug`, check specific **limits** and **features**, and verify **LoRA** availability. Please **omit** the LoRA parameter by default during initial testing.
