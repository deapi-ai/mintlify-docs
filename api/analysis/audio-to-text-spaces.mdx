## Technical Notes & Constraints

### Spaces Support

- **Completed Spaces Only**: The API does not support live (ongoing) X Spaces. If a URL for an active Space is provided, the API will return a validation error. Please ensure the Space has ended before submission.
- **Max Duration**: 90 minutes

### Progress Tracking (URL/Spaces)

- **Download Phase:** Due to external stream handling, the task progress will remain at 0% for the entire duration of the audio download.
- **Transcription Phase**: Once the download is complete, the progress status will jump to 50% and update incrementally until finished.
- A prolonged 0% status is normal behavior for long X Spaces.

<Info>
Transcription for standard video posts on X is handled via the [Video-to-Text](/api/analysis/video-to-text) endpoint.
