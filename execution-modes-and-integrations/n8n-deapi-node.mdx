title: "n8n deAPI node"
---

This guide explains how to integrate deAPI with a **self-hosted n8n instance** using the official deAPI community node. The community node provides a simpler, no-code experience compared to the [HTTP Request-based approach](/execution-modes-and-integrations/n8n-integration).

---

### Why Use the Community Node?

The `n8n-nodes-deapi` community node offers several advantages over manually configuring HTTP Request nodes:

| Feature              | Community Node                  | HTTP Request Approach             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Setup Complexity** | One-time installation           | Manual configuration per workflow |
| **Job Completion**   | Automatic webhook-based waiting | Manual polling loop required      |
| **Binary Data**      | Auto-downloaded and attached    | Manual download step needed       |
| **Error Handling**   | Built-in with clear messages    | Manual status checking            |
| **Credential Reuse** | Shared across all operations    | Configure per node                |

---

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A **self-hosted n8n instance** accessible via **HTTPS** (required for webhook callbacks)
- A **deAPI API key** from the [deAPI Dashboard](https://docs.deapi.ai/quickstart#2-obtain-your-api-key)
- A **Webhook Secret** from [deAPI Webhook Settings](https://deapi.ai/settings/webhooks)

<Warning>
  The deAPI node uses webhooks to receive job completion notifications. Your n8n instance must be accessible via HTTPS for generation operations to work.
</Warning>

---

### Installation

#### Option 1: GUI Installation (Recommended)

1. In your n8n instance, go to **Settings** \> **Community Nodes**
2. Click **Install a community node**
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-deapi` and click **Install**
4. Restart n8n if prompted

#### Option 2: Manual Installation (docker)

If you're running n8n via docker:

```bash
docker exec -it <n8n-docker> sh
mkdir ~/.n8n/nodes
cd ~/.n8n/nodes
npm i n8n-nodes-deapi
```

Then restart your n8n instance.

---

### Credential Configuration

After installation, configure your deAPI credentials:

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** \> **Add Credential**
2. Search for **deAPI API** and select it
3. Fill in the required fields:

| Field              | Description                             | Where to Get It                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Key**        | Your deAPI API key for authentication   | [deAPI Quickstart Guide](https://docs.deapi.ai/quickstart#2-obtain-your-api-key) |
| **Webhook Secret** | Secret for verifying webhook signatures | [deAPI Webhook Settings](https://deapi.ai/settings/webhooks)                     |

4. Click **Save** to store the credentials

<Note>
  The Webhook Secret is used to verify that incoming webhook notifications are genuinely from deAPI. Keep it secure and never share it publicly.
</Note>

#### DeapiTrigger Node (Webhook Trigger)

Use this node to start workflows when deAPI sends job status updates. This is useful for:

- Building event-driven workflows
- Processing results from jobs submitted outside n8n
- Monitoring job progress across multiple systems

---

### How the Webhook-Based Waiting Works

Generation operations (image, video, transcription) use an efficient webhook-based pattern instead of polling:

```
1. Execute Phase

   +-----------+     POST /txt2img      +-----------+
   |   Deapi   | ---------------------> |   deAPI   |
   |   Node    |   (includes webhook)   |   Server  |
   +-----------+                        +-----------+
        |
        v
   Workflow pauses
   (frees memory)

2. Processing Phase (no n8n resources used)

   +-----------+                        +-----------+
   |    n8n    |  <-- job.processing    |   deAPI   |
   | (waiting) |     (acknowledged)     | (working) |
   +-----------+                        +-----------+

3. Resume Phase

   +-----------+                        +-----------+
   |    n8n    |  <-- job.completed     |   deAPI   |
   | (resumes) |   (with result_url)    |  (done)   |
   +-----------+                        +-----------+
        |
        v
   Workflow continues
   with generated content
```

**Key benefits:**

- No polling loop consuming API calls
- Workflow pauses and frees memory during processing
- Results include binary data ready for downstream nodes

### Example Workflow: Text-to-Image Generation

This example demonstrates a simple image generation workflow.

#### Workflow Overview

```
+------------------+      +-------------------+
|  Manual Trigger  | ---> |    Deapi Node     |
|                  |      | (Image: Generate) |
+------------------+      +-------------------+
                                   |
                                   v
                          Generated image as
                          binary data output
```

#### Step 1: Add a Trigger

Add a **Manual Trigger** (or Schedule, Webhook, etc.) to start your workflow.

#### Step 2: Add the Deapi Node

1. Add a **Deapi** node to your workflow
2. Select your **deAPI API** credentials
3. Configure the operation:

| Setting          | Value                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Resource**     | Image                                    |
| **Operation**    | Generate                                 |
| **Model**        | FLUX.1 Schnell (or your preferred model) |
| **Prompt**       | `Red Bull F1 car from 2025`              |
| **Aspect Ratio** | Square, Landscape, or Portrait           |

4. Optionally configure:
   - **Negative Prompt** — Elements to exclude from the image
   - **Resolution** — Select image dimensions other than the default ones, depending on your needs
   - **Seed** — For reproducible results (use `-1` for random)
   - **Steps** — Number of inference steps (higher = more detail)

#### Step 3: Run the Workflow

1. Click **Test Workflow** or **Execute Workflow**
2. The node will:
   - Submit the generation request to deAPI
   - Pause the workflow while waiting
   - Resume automatically when the image is ready
3. The output contains the generated image as binary data

#### Using the Generated Image

The image is available in the `data` binary field. Connect downstream nodes to:

- **Write Binary File** — Save to disk
- **Send Email** — Attach to an email
- **HTTP Request** — Upload to cloud storage
- **Slack/Discord** — Share in a channel

### Using the DeapiTrigger Node

The **DeapiTrigger** node listens for webhook events from deAPI, enabling event-driven workflows.

#### Setup

1. Add a **DeapiTrigger** node to a new workflow
2. Select your **deAPI API** credentials
3. Configure event filtering:

| Setting                    | Description                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Events**                 | Select which events trigger the workflow: Processing, Completed, Failed |
| **Download Binary Result** | Automatically download the result file for completed jobs               |

4. **Activate the workflow** to make the webhook URL live
5. Copy the **Webhook URL** displayed in the node
6. Add this URL to your [deAPI Webhook Settings](https://deapi.ai/settings/webhooks)

#### Event Types

| Event              | Description                | Typical Use                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **job.processing** | Job has started processing | Update status in external system  |
| **job.completed**  | Job finished successfully  | Process the generated content     |
| **job.failed**     | Job encountered an error   | Handle errors, send notifications |

### Comparison: Community Node vs HTTP Request

| Aspect                  | Community Node                | HTTP Request Approach                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Nodes Required**      | 1 (Deapi node)                | 5+ (Submit, Poll loop, Check, Wait, Download) |
| **Polling Logic**       | Automatic webhook             | Manual polling loop with Wait node            |
| **Binary Handling**     | Auto-downloaded               | Manual HTTP Request to download               |
| **Error Messages**      | Clear, contextual             | Raw API responses                             |
| **Credential Setup**    | Once per n8n instance         | Once per n8n instance                         |
| **Rate Limit Handling** | Built-in with helpful message | Manual detection and handling                 |
| **Code Required**       | None                          | Expressions for URL templating                |

---

### Troubleshooting

#### HTTPS Required

Generation operations require your n8n instance to be accessible via HTTPS for webhook callbacks.

**Solutions:**

- Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) with SSL termination
- Use a tunnel service (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel) for development
- Ensure your SSL certificate is valid and not self-signed

#### Webhook Verification Failures

If you see webhook signature verification errors:

1. Verify your **Webhook Secret** matches the one in [deAPI Webhook Settings](https://deapi.ai/settings/webhooks)
2. Ensure your n8n server clock is synchronized (signature includes timestamp)
3. Check that no proxy is modifying the request body

#### Timeout Errors

Operations have a configurable **Wait Timeout** with defaults that vary by type:

| Operation Type               | Default Timeout | Max Timeout |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Generation (image, video)    | 60 seconds      | 240 seconds |
| Transcription (video, audio) | 120 seconds     | 600 seconds |

For long-running operations:

1. Select the Deapi node
2. Expand **Options**
3. Increase **Wait Timeout** to allow more time

#### Rate Limiting

If you see "upgrade your plan" errors, you've hit deAPI's rate limits. Consider upgrading your deAPI plan for higher limits.
