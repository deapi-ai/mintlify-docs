title: "Limits & Quotas"

This section contains a description of rate limits and file upload specifications.

deAPI is engineered for High Throughput capability upon deployment. Unlike traditional providers, API scalability is not restricted by complex access tiers during the initial integration phase.

### Rate Limits

The default rate limit for all standard accounts is: 300 jobs / minute (applicable to all task types: video, audio, image).

#### Comparison: deAPI vs. Traditional Providers

Many AI infrastructure providers enforce restrictive initial limits (RPM - Requests Per Minute), necessitating complex queue management systems for developers.

**Availability**

- Traditional Providers (e.g., OpenAI Tier 1): Often restricted to low RPM values (approx. 3 RPM) upon account creation.
- deAPI: 300 RPM available immediately upon registration.

**Scaling**

- Traditional Providers: Typically require specific monetary spend thresholds and time delays to advance to higher Tiers.
- deAPI: High throughput limits are provisioned instantly without a waiting period.

**Complexity**

- Traditional Providers: Often utilize separate quotas for tokens (TPM), requests (RPM), and daily limits (RPD).
- deAPI: Unified limit structure: 300 jobs per minute.

Limits within deAPI are dynamic. Higher quotas may be provisioned based on platform utilization (credit usage). For High Volume Production requirements, please contact support via: support@deapi.ai

### File Uploads

The majority of endpoints (Video-to-Text, Audio-to-Text, Image-to-Image) support direct binary file uploads or URL-based inputs. The global limits for file uploads are specified below.

**1. Video** (Video-to-Text, Image-to-Video)

- Max size: 100 MB
- Supported Formats: mp4, avi, mov, mkv, webm

**2. Audio** (Audio-to-Text)

- Max size: 50 MB (recommended), up to 100 MB
- Supported Formats: mp3, wav, m4a, flac, ogg

**3. Images** (Image-to-Image, OCR)

- Max size: 10 MB
- Supported Formats: jpg, png, webp

### URL Input & Duration Limits

For endpoints processing content via direct URLs (e.g., X Spaces), specific duration limits apply regardless of file size.

**1. Audio-to-Text** (X/Twitter Spaces)

- Max Duration: 90 minutes
- Note: Processing speeds for X Spaces may vary due to external bandwidth limits.
