Example pricing is shown below for reference; exact, up-to-date rates are always available from the API.

**deAPI** uses a **pay-as-you-go pricing model**, where costs are calculated dynamically per task based on the resource usage, such as resolution, steps, duration, or number of output characters. The pricing examples shown on the public site (https://deapi.ai/#pricing) serve as reference points; final cost is determined by the API at runtime depending on the selected model and parameters.

### Pricing by Task

**Text-to-Image (Image Generation)**

- Users define width, height, steps via the API or UI.
- Public example: Flux Schnell model is used to estimate cost in the UI; for example, 512x512 at 4 steps gives **0.00136 USD**. For the Z-Image-Turbo INT8 model with the same parameters, the price is **0.00405 USD**, but the advantage is very realistic images.
- Higher resolutions and more steps yield better quality but incur higher cost.
- Important: For models other than Flux Schnell, pricing is model-specific and calculated on the server side.

**Text-to-Speech (TTS / Speech Generation)**

- Charged per character in your input (e.g. 1M characters → **0.77 USD**).
- Playback speed modifiers:
  - Standard (1.0×): base cost
  - Fast (2.0×): 0.5× the base cost
  - Slow (0.5×): 2.0× the base cost
- Useful tip: using faster playback (2×) for drafts can reduce cost by ~50%.

**Text-to-Video**

- Price depends on clip duration (2–5 seconds) and resolution.
- Example public rate: **0.001737 USD** for a 2-second clip at 256x256.
- You can scale resolution or duration, but cost increases accordingly.

**Image-to-Image (Image Transformation)**

- Transforms an existing image based on a new prompt or style.
- Pricing scales with the number of inference steps and GPU time required — similar to Text-to-Image tasks.
- Example: a 20-step transformation costs roughly the same as generating a 512×512 image.
- Fewer steps → faster & cheaper transfers; more steps → better fidelity.

**Image-to-Video**

- Transform a static image into a motion clip (2–5 seconds) with interpolation.
- Example: 256x256 for 2 seconds costs **0.001737 USD**.
- Use lower resolution or shorter duration to reduce cost.
- Use motion parameters in prompts to guide movement.

**Video-to-Text (Transcription)**

- Billed per hour of video processed.
- Sample public rate: **0.021 USD per hour**.
- For 5 minutes, cost is estimated at **0.003613 USD**.
- Supports timestamps, multilingual transcription, and batching for better throughput.

**Image-to-Text (OCR / VLM)**

- Charged based on number of characters recognized in output.
- Baseline rate: **0.00928 USD** per 1,000 output characters (for 1024×1024 images).
- Example outputs:
  - Single photo (≈20 chars) → **0.000186 USD**
  - Math expression (~350 chars) → **0.0032 USD**
  - Book page (~1,500 chars) → **0.0139 USD**
- Volume discounts available for bulk processing (100k+ images)—contact sales.

**Text-to-Embedding (Vector Representations)**

- Pricing is based on the number of tokens processed.
- Sample public rate: **0.000093 USD** per 1,000 tokens (client-side pricing).
- Embeddings are typically used for semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), clustering, and similarity matching.
- Costs scale linearly with token count, making it efficient even at large volumes.
- Important: Different embedding models may have varying dimensionality (e.g. 768 vs. 1024), but pricing is standardized per token for simplicity.

### Best Practices & Guidance

- Use the public calculator as a guide, but always rely on the API's final cost calculation (model + parameters).
- Avoid hardcoding prices or cost assumptions—always fetch or compute cost based on actual model usage.
- For reproducibility (e.g. in production or experiments), pin model versions and seeds so results are consistent across runs.
- Prepare fallback options in your integration: if a model is deprecated or disabled, switch to a sensible alternative automatically.
- Monitor usage and budget: higher resolution, longer clips, or more steps increase costs proportionally.
